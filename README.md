The RollDice Application
------------------------

About:
This is my android port of idea I had a long time using MFC back during WinXP area.
I have updated it using .NET but I wanted to create a Android Application for this also.

Overall Objectives for this application
---------------------------------------
1. Roll Any Type that is given [D4/D6/D10/D12/D20/D100]
2. Get the total for those rolled
3. Get a history of those rolled
    A. Ability to save them to a file for future showing
	  B. Ability to be cleared so that a new history can be started
	  For Example:
	  1D4 = 3
	  3D8 = 15 [6 6 3]
	  2D6+4 = 11 [4 3]
	  8d6 = [1 6 3 5 4 4 5 2] = 30
4. Customization [Name]
